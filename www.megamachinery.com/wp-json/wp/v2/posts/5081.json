In daily observation, pay attention to the operation of the machine and some conversion actions of feeding and removing bottles, etc. When some minor problems are found, stop the operation immediately and solve them quickly to reduce some unnecessary losses. Daily maintenance work is almost always carried out when the machine is running, including checking all adjustable data such as mold closing time, delayed blowing time, pre-blowing time, bottle blowing time, etc. And daily maintenance is not static, it depends on the operation and environmental conditions of the machine. Therefore, to make the machine run smoothly, when the bottle inventory is sufficient or the machine stop time is appropriate, a thorough inspection will be more conducive to the operation of the machine. The operator should pay attention to whether the oil level of the air compressor lubricating oil is sufficient.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cleaning<\/strong><br>\nKeeping the machine clean in daily maintenance will help the machine run smoothly. When wiping excess grease on the machine, especially when wiping excess grease on the connecting rod of the mold closing mechanism, the machine must be stopped.<\/p>\n<p>Check whether the screws of each part are loose, whether the position fixing nuts of each group of proximity switches are loose, and whether the conveyor belt of the feeder is too loose.<br>\n<strong>Daily inspection and maintenance items:<\/strong><br>\n\u2474 Check the quality of the bottle.<br>\n\u2475 Whether the circulating water is blocked<br>\n\u2476 Listen to whether the machine has abnormal sounds and whether the pipeline is leaking<br>\n\u2477 Check whether the fixing nuts of each solenoid valve coil are loose<br>\n\u2478 Check whether each pipeline is bent<br>\n\u2479 Discharge the drain valve of the air storage cylinder and related equipment (please drain every four hours in places with high humidity)<br>\n\u247a Check whether the operating circuit and high-pressure blowing pressure are normal<br>\n\u247b Check whether the tension dry fixing bolts and fiber screws are loose<br>\n\u247c Check the bottom drive travel nut<br>\n\u247d Check whether the oil mist is sufficient, whether the oil of the motor speed gearbox is sufficient, and the lubricating oil is L-DAB150 in summer and L-DAB100 in winter.<br>\n\u247e Is the exhaust fan normal?<br>\n\u247f Check the air compressor lubricating oil once a day[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n<\/body><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]I am text block.
