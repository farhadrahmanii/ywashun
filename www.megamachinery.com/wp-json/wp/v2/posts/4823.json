The resulting polymer. PET plastic has the characteristics of light weight, high transparency, impact resistance and resistance to breakage. It can also prevent carbon dioxide gas and keep the soda \u201cgas\u201d. PET bottles have strong applicability and are widely used in daily necessities, daily chemical packaging and other fields. From mold processing to machinery and equipment, they are very picky, easy to get started, but difficult to do.<br>\nPET bottles are processed by blow molding to form plastic bottles, including bottles used for packaging cosmetics, medicines, health care, beverages, mineral water, reagents, etc. This kind of bottle making method is called a two-step method, that is, a preform is formed through injection Blow molding process to form PET plastic bottles. The quality of PET bottles depends on the quality of the supplied preforms. The following are common problems and corresponding solutions in the production of PET bottles.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n<\/body><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>PET bottle refers to the bottle containing a plastic material called polyethylene terephthalate&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":4802,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"nf_dc_page":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-4823","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-uncategorized"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/www.megamachinery.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/4nn.jpg","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.megamachinery.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4823","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.megamachinery.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.megamachinery.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.megamachinery.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.megamachinery.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4823"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/www.megamachinery.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4823\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":4825,"href":"https:\/\/www.megamachinery.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4823\/revisions\/4825"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.megamachinery.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/4802"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.megamachinery.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4823"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.megamachinery.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4823"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.megamachinery.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4823"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
